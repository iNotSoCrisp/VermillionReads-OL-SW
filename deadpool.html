                <p>"Bloody, disturbing, episodic, and absolutely the most perfect Deadpool story that needed to be told.

                    Contrary to what many of the reviews say, there is a distinct reason Wade sets on killing the entirety of the Marvel Universe... He comes to fully realize that his life, and the lives of everyone in the Marvel Universe, exist only for the entertainment value of an outside observer: Us.
                    
                    It's not random, it's not pointless, it's not about blood n guts (though they are present in spades). It's about finally ending the constant torment that the people in the Marvel Universe endure for nothing more than our own entertainment. Wade doesn't just want to break the fourth wall, he wants to tear down every wall he sees.
                    
                    In this story, the reader comes to realize that Wade's breaking of the fourth wall is far more sinister, disturbing, and existential than most previous writers have implied. He knows that the struggles, the pain, the deaths and rebirths are all the result of other human minds creating fiction. He never says this on-the-nose, but it's abundantly clear that he's ending the charade of the Marvel Universe, and aiming to avenge the fact that he even exists to begin with. We see the result of this realization as it dawns on Professor Xavier, and it drives him into a catatonic state.
                    
                    "</p>

                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★☆</p>
                <p>"I get the impression that this is the sort of comic that you will either greatly dislike or love in spite of yourself. Oddly enough, I found myself in the latter camp.

                    It's the ultimate in gratuitous violence, an entire series created simply to revel in Deadpool's ability to unleash terrifying levels of gory violence. And also his tendency to be divorced from his reality, and to lean heavily on the fourth wall. In this case, he's seeing beyond the fourth wall entirely, and he's far more cracked and violent than he's ever been before.
                    
                    And believe it or not, it's hugely entertaining. It isn't a Deadpool-style absurd laugh fest, but there are definitely funny moments. But mostly the appeal is the senseless violence, which is absurdly enjoyable to read.
