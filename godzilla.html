                <p>"Overall, this book was amazing concerning Godzilla's travel through hell. The series does not bother to explain how Godzilla dies, which is a bad point, but I'm willing to let that slide. The first issue sees Godzilla entering Hell, and being attacked by the large masses of his victims as well as a demon disguising itself as another Godzilla. The second issue has amazing artwork, and the monologue that was occurring fitted well with the battle, since we see Godzilla fight two monsters that are considered friends of his in some films, as well as 2 others that are enemies. The third issue provides a flashback that shows Godzilla fighting his space counterpart, and then appears to die. He seems to have been given a chance to enter heaven, but instead chooses to enter hell, and rejects the offer from Heaven to fight hell. The artwork for the 4th issue is the weakest of the series in my opinion, only due to how Godzilla was drawn. The last issue shows Godzilla finishing his travel through hell, in which Godzilla's fresh is consumed by demonic creatures, but forces them to act as his new flesh, and allows for his being able to destroy the monster blocking him from returning to the land of the living. The story itself is great, since we are shown a journey that Godzilla might possible go through every time he dies, and the struggle he goes through before being able to escape seems to be true Hell. Overall, I would recommend this book, even if you are starting off with Godzilla.

                <p>"What a stupid idea. What AMAZING execution! I can't believe how well this works. There's barely any words, just a big monster wandering through the various circles of hell. But the tone really sells it, and the different artists really make it come alive. Godzilla comics tend to be doomed to the typical mediocrity of franchise tie-ins, but this rises above for a genuinely new experience.
                    I also highly recommend Stokoe's Half-Century War. Very different but just as good."</p>
