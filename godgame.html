            <p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>The supreme Gods who had too much free time created the ultimate brain games "Play of the Gods." Former Goddess Leche awoke from a long slumber and declared to the world, "Bring forth the person who is the best in games in this era!" Fay is nominated to represent humanity as the "best rookie in recent years."

                The "Game of the Gods" that is about to begin between the two may be a little too difficult, as there has yet to be a victor throughout human history, because Gods are capricious, very unreasonable, and sometimes completely incomprehensible. However, given the nature of the games, it would be a waste not to have a good time and play with all of one's heart! The ultimate brain battles of a genius gamer boy, a former Goddess, and friends begin!

                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★☆☆</p>
                <p>"I really don't understand the underlying logic

                    Gods play games with humans because they are bored - so far so good
                    
                    Gods like it when the games are a challenge - I kind of get it but the challenge is biased because the gods seem to make it hard for the humans but easy for themselves
                    
                    Gods like fair games - but then the first game in the book begins with rule breaks of the god and without explaining the rules
                    
                    What I get so far is the focus can't be the games even though they really take up many pages of the novel - focus seems on the relation or romance of the main characters"</p>

                <p>"Gods' Games We Play was fantastic, I rate 5/5 because the detail of the book makes you feel absorbed while reading. The book has a good world building and it is easy to follow, it has a variety of vocabulary choices that would benefit in learning. I would 100% recommend the novel for anyone who is interested in the anime genre."
