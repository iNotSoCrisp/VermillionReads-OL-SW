            <p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Though she doesn't play many MMOs, Maple has either a natural talent or impossibly good luck, because by pouring every last stat point she has into Vitality, she's created a character who can't be hurt! Whether it's physical attacks or magic or status effects, nothing poses a real threat. In no time at all, news spreads across the server about the adorable terror who can't be defeated. While Maple may just be having fun, her broken build is sure to attract lots of unexpected attention...

                <p>"There isn't a lot to say about that series, and whether or not you should give it a try is summed up by that question: "Do you want to follow a cute op girl doing cute op thing in an MMO with other op and sometimes also cute friends ?".

                    -If the answer is yes then go on, it's not a great LN with interesting plot and characters but it's clearly not trying to be that anyway, it's just a relaxing fluffy story about a cute girl.
                    As far as I've gone it doesn't seem like there's any bigger plot either, it's just an MMO and it doesn't seem like the management has some hidden agenda or that there's some hidden truth behind the game.
                    
                    -If the answer is no then, don't bother there's nothing here for you, if you want a MMO LN try "Infinite Dendrogram" which for all its flaws does have deeper stories and characters."</p>

                <p>"It reminds me of the series "Avatar: The last airbender" in the sense that it's not only about fighting; they also go out of their way to have fun experiences. It's really sad that the anime isn't adding more of those adventures.

                    When there are fights, the fight scenes well animated, and the characters come up with creative ways to overcome challenges. It's not just "I yell really loudly for a long time, so I can become stronger"
                    
                    
                    *My favorite thing about the MC, is that Maple doesn't take herself overly seriously. In fact, she doesn't do anything expecting to become OP, she's just trying to have fun, while focusing on making herself hard to kill. They come up with cool & creative ways to overcome challenges.
                    
                    **I'm a huge fan of the latest Dragonball movie, and i'm a sucker for shounen/action anime. However I definitely appreciate creativity & fun, more than outright brute force.
                    
                    ***One thing I want to note: I've only been able to find 14 translated chapters of the manga. The rest i've read from web novels, or i've seen some untranslated copies."
