                    This is a brilliant series, the ideal example of how to utilize a second life correctly.

                    The MC is a former degenerate noble who decided to embark on the path of good in his 2nd life.
                    It doesn't end there, he carries an impressive resolve to follow through with his objectives while making use of his knowledge of his 1st life.
                    
                    A Flame Reborn is unique in exploring creative aspects of how an MC can utilize knowledge to make everyone's lives better. He is thinking only of the people while he expresses only goodwill and kindness to everyone.
                    
                    This Manhwa is like really funny if you read it yourself.....there are great ways to make money..in ways we couldn't possibly think of.
                    I am always a fan of MCs who follow up on their resolves.                </p>

                    If you're a fan of regression manhwa and haven't delved into this gem, I wholeheartedly suggest giving it a read.
                    MC is not to op, MC keeps getting stronger and you see that progress, and the MC is kind a smart. However, Chapter by chapter this manhwa growing and put lots of interesting plots.
