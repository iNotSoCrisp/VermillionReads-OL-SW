                From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.” One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas. Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become? Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.

                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★☆</p>
                <p>I heard about this book from the author once he was interviewed on NPR. I thought I knew what to expect from it. I didn´t.
                    Although the book is lacking structure in terms of the way Harari handled the topic, I truly enjoyed reading it.
                    He divides different phases of Sapien´s development into Agricultural Revolution, Cognitive Revolution and Scientific Revolution. Since the subject is considerably broad, it is not unusual that alongside gods, universe, money, human rights, social patterns, Christianity, dharma, colonialism, the author writes also about new technologies, the immense diversity of imagined realities that Sapiens invented, capitalism, Karl Marx, the discovery of America and much more. I felt like we jumped very quickly from the story about Neanthertal to the question like "what maintains the military order?" or from the image of hunter-gatherer to the portrait of Buddha.
                    Nevertheless, I really admire his style of writing and before all, I agree with him.
