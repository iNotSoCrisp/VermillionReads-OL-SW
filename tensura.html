                    Man, this gets amazing volume after volume, although I read in English translation so I likely would have stopped after Vol.16 (which is the latest official translation till today) but I moved further and read fan translations and even Vol.20, which I was not able to find even the fan one, I read the one which gets translated by the AI or different apps.
                    Yea it gets a bit boring during the Founder festival arc considering the whole story but after that it stars to get amazing and thrilling bit by bit (excluding Vol. 17).
                    I really hope even if the story of Rimuru ends the author will continue to write the stories of other characters in the Tensura world indulging our privious characters to make things little spicy.                </p>
