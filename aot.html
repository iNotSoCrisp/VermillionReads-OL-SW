            <p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Hundreds of years ago, horrifying creatures which resembled humans appeared. These mindless, towering giants, called Titans, proved to be an existential threat, as they preyed on whatever humans they could find in order to satisfy a seemingly unending appetite. Unable to effectively combat the Titans, mankind was forced to barricade themselves within large walls surrounding what may very well be humanity's last safe haven in the world.

                In the present day, life within the walls has finally found peace, since the residents have not dealt with Titans for many years. Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert are three young children who dream of experiencing all that the world has to offer, having grown up hearing stories of the wonders beyond the walls. But when the state of tranquility is suddenly shattered by the attack of a massive 60-meter Titan, they quickly learn just how cruel the world can be. On that day, Eren makes a promise to himself that he will do whatever it takes to eradicate every single Titan off the face of the Earth, with the hope that one day, humanity will once again be able to live outside the walls without fear.</p>

                <p>"First of all, if you haven't read Shingeki no Kyojin yet, go do it. I'm not usually this enthusiastic about shounen manga, but SNK has managed to become the exception, simply because it's so damn good. Why? What makes it better than other works in similar genres? Well, my little ones, SNK is so well thought out. Meticulously so. From the plot to the characters, everything has just that extra layer that pushes SNK to become an outstanding piece of writing. There are plot twists often, and boy, can they catch you off guard. All of the characters contribute to the development of the story and each other. I'm picky when meeting characters, and even though this manga has about 1,000,000 of them, it is easy to differentiate and love even the most minor. This is definitely a story that I would buy and read over and over until the pages are worn.

                    And, well, as for the art.... There are some 'inconsistencies' that kind of annoy me - mainly that they way jaws are drawn from profile makes their faces look like tomato cans - but aside from minor things, it is a refreshing style. Isayama's art doesn't have "copy/paste face" - meaning that the only thing that physically changes from character to character is the eye size -- rather each character has their own specific features. It doesn't sound like that much to ask for, but this is regrettably rare for anime/manga. It's actually quite daring, and I can appreciate a good oasis in the desert of generalized faces.
                    
                    Overall, this is the kind of manga that makes you think. I've been reading for a long time, but never have I spent so much time going over possibilities and predictions in my head. Not only that, but you genuinely care about what's happening. It's the kind of story that your jaw drops, your eyes widen, and your heart beat wildly with anticipation. And as for the fandom, it has an amazing range of artists, writers, thinkers, and crackifiers, and I enjoy every second of being apart of it.
                    
                    Simply put, Shingeki no Kyojin is fantastic; a regular 10/10 would bang. I'd recommend it to anyone, even people who don't read manga. Go. Go read it now. Then friend me so we can talk about it into the wee hours of the morning.

                <p>"For this manga, the reader needs to be a super active reader. One has to pay attention to every page, panel, behavior of the characters, even random stuff in the background needs your attention in order to understand what's going on, and to make smart predictions/theories of the storyline.
                    One on the best pieces of literature that I have read in a long time."</p>
