                <p>"A succeeding story for The Infinity Gauntlet, The Infinity War proves to be just as magnificent. The tense dynamic between Adam Warlock and his darker half The Magus -- as well as supporting characters like Thanos the Mad Titan and Galactus -- takes us on a wild ride as we once again witness this vast and diverse plethora of Marvel characters endure yet another universe-threatening conflict pertaining to the Infinity Gauntlet. The side story of Doctor Doom and Kang the Conqueror makes this story all the more interesting and in addition, Warlock, Magus, and Thanos deliver some of the best lines yet. Whether or not you read the issues of "I, Thanos" & "Warlock and the Infinity Watch," this story arc is action-packed, although nothing -- not even this -- beats the predecessor which is The Infinity Gauntlet. There is splendid character development in Thanos and Warlock, and I hope I get to see a good side to the former when the Infinity War film releases later this Spring in May. As for Warlock, the ending had my attention and I was left wondering whether I should read the next installment of this comic trilogy, The Infinity Crusade.

                <p>"Well, I'm not going to lie to you. I really liked that shit.

                    Besides the artwork not being my favourite half the time throughout this whole story, everything else was really captivating. Really interesting as to where it's going to lead and all.
                    
                    Mainly, I was reading this because of (duh) Thanos.. and that's what I'm binge-reading nowadays just before the movie, so yeah, I remember reading this back in the 90s, I remember NOT finishing reading this, I think I missed issues or something and I wasn't too much into it or something. Stupid kid and everything. I blame not being into cosmic stuff from Marvel back then. Oh well...
                    
                    If you want some Thanos and some Warlock and some Infinity Gauntlet Aftermath, this is your jam.
                    
                    This is your jam and your jelly.
                    
                    I liked it. Maybe even too much than I should have.
                    
                    Highly recommended for Thanos stuff."</p>
