            <br>
            <p>
                Philomel—the fake princess—conspires with her mother to impersonate the imperial princess and cause a war between the Mage Tower and the Empire. Once her crimes were exposed, she was sentenced to execution. A death truly befitting of a wicked—

                "Even if the Philomel within the book had done some wrong, it wasn't enough to warrant death!" Philomel yelled and threw the book she'd been reading. She had simply been curious about a book she'd picked up in the garden, but the contents of the book stated that she would die!
                Although she wanted to believe it was nothing but fiction, everything that happened from that moment onward went just like in the book.
                
                "Since it has come to this... my goal is to survive!" Will Philomel be able to discover the origins of the suspicious book and live on?            </p>

                    The story has a few holes, but is fairly well put together. Due to the realistic portrayals of anxiety and trauma, the tormented protagonist does not forget or forgive her abusers. And she has difficulties accepting love and affection, which makes for a much more interesting Otome isekai than most of this type where it is common for protagonists in manhwa with this premise to quicky earn their family's love through cuteness and luck, and forgive their past cruelty.

                    Lastly, the world building did not have a lot of effort put into it, but it is serviceable for the story.                </p>

                    The characters are quite well written, though they do fall within common tropes for this subgenre. I was quite impressed by how well the story portrays anxiety and paranoia. It is in part why the story was able to stand apart from manhwa with a similar premise.
