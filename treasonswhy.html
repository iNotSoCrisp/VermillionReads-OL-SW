                You can’t stop the future.
                You can’t rewind the past.
                The only way to learn the secret . . . is to press play.
                
                Clay Jensen returns home from school to find a strange package with his name on it lying on his porch. Inside he discovers several cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker–his classmate and crush–who committed suicide two weeks earlier. Hannah’s voice tells him that there are thirteen reasons why she decided to end her life. Clay is one of them. If he listens, he’ll find out why.
                
                Clay spends the night crisscrossing his town with Hannah as his guide. He becomes a firsthand witness to Hannah’s pain, and as he follows Hannah’s recorded words throughout his town, what he discovers changes his life forever.

                <p>this one is hard to rate, for one part I can relate to the feeling that the main character Hanna had in killing herself and mailing tapes to every person that affected her life explaining how they had affected her (I had kind of the same idea when I was a teen), but then now that I have grown up I don't think that would be the right thing to do , because Its just going to affect that person for the rest of their life and its going to make them feel guilty, In a suicide while there are factors that influence that decision and people too , at the end the decision is yours and yours alone, something the character declares in the book although not in a convincing way. So there you go, teen suicide is always a hard topic to approach, the story was rushed a little bit and I felt that we never get a connection with Clay (the one who gets the tapes ), it all feels rushed. I chose to read this book because I am interested in watching the Netflix series , but I wanted to read the book first .

                <p>"Wow is this a powerful book. I thought I would have some problems reading it due to my own mental illness but it's super impactful and brings a lot of questions to my mind. Now I feel like I might actually watch the Netflix show to see how they did with it, I hope it does the story and suicide awareness justice."</p>
