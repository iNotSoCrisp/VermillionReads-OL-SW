            <p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>"One day, a four-year-old boy came to a sudden realization: the world is not fair. Eighty percent of the world's population wield special abilities, known as "quirks," which have given many the power to make their childhood dreams of becoming a superhero a reality. Unfortunately, Izuku Midoriya was one of the few born without a quirk, suffering from discrimination because of it. Yet, he refuses to give up on his dream of becoming a hero; determined to do the impossible, Izuku sets his sights on the elite hero training academy, UA High.

                However, everything changes after a chance meeting with the number one hero and Izuku's idol, All Might. Discovering that his dream is not a dead end, the powerless boy undergoes special training, working harder than ever before. Eventually, this leads to him inheriting All Might's power, and with his newfound abilities, gets into his school of choice, beginning his grueling journey to become the successor of the best hero on the planet.

                <p>"What seems to be the next big thing in Boku no Hero Academia certainly has the potential to do so, but has a long way to go before it gets there. So far, its every piece of copy and paste material and generic story out there. However, one thing that intrigued me was how well it used its generic story and characters. The first chapter speaks to itself honestly. Izuku our main character has a problem that gets dealt with in a very very satisfying way that got hooked and invested in the story. The story is interesting and the world is simple, but can be built upon. The characters all remind me of the Konoha 11 from Naruto. Each one of them have their own special abilities and personalities. Its refreshing.

                    One of the best things Boku no Hero Academia does in my very own personal opinion, is its detail. For instance, you just can't have super strength, without there being some sort of burden on your body, or you cant just shoot fire from your hand. There's a scientific explanation to everything, which reminds me a lot of Hunter x Hunter. What I also love, is Izukus personality. Sure hes the stereotypical bullied MC trying to become stronger, but really how he separates himself from other MC's is his intelligence and his battle strategies. He doesn't rely only on his quirk, but his brains allowing what seems impossible situations seem possible, thus hinting a common theme shown in the series. Everyone is not born equal
                    
                    Overall, while objectively, yes, it is nowhere near special or the best thing I have ever read in my entire life, but it does what it does greatly, and it makes it worthwhile. I'm excited for the future of the series, hope it keeps improving ^_^

                <p>"This manga is a journey not only in following the students in their quest to become heroes, but also in the highs and lows of story telling. BnHA starts out strong. The characters are likeable and engaging. The story has a lot to say and invests as much time in its villains as its heroes, creating a complex world with complex problems. The first about half of the story is the best part of the story. It has decent pacing, engaging content, and a need to know more. The second half is unfortunately not like that. The pacing is a little wonky in places, though it's better as a binge read than a weekly read. There are some really great moments but there is some clutter and speed runs in-between. Yet, the themes presented in the first half persist and so there's still a drive to know more about the characters and story. This kept me reading even during the wonky portions but the payout just evaporated when the time came for it.

                    One of the more interesting things about Horikoshi's writing is he likes to subvert expectations, but this is also one of his weaknesses. The ending really let me down to the point I'm not going to finish the anime because I have no interest in watching the final arc after reading it. The epilogue was nice but because of the disappointment in the climax of the story, I have trouble enjoying it.
                    
                    When I first started reading this title, I rated it an 8. When the second half got wonky, I rated it a 7. Now I'm giving it a 6. It's a decent story and the characters are characters that I'll carry with me for years to come, but the ending was just not my bag, but it wasn't technically a "bad ending," just extremely disappointing given what seemed to be the themes of the story. However, some subversions in the epilogue were good and I'm glad for those choices. It's really a mixed bag of an ending to a manga that started out pretty strong and engaging.
                    
                    If you like standard Jump stories and enjoy epics reads, then I would really recommend checking this title out. Even though I didn't really like the ending, it might work for other people. If anything, this manga is worth it to get to know the cast and think about how things could have turned out instead.
