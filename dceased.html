            <br>
            <p>What happens to the World's Finest if the world ends? With death spreading across the planet, who will live and who will turn in this apocalyptic tale of heroism, sacrifice and annihilation?

                It's the end of the world as we know it!
                
                Six hundred million people worldwide are instantly turned into violent, monstrous engines of destruction when their minds are recoded with a corrupted Anti-Life Equation from Apokolips. The heroes of Earth are fighting a losing battle to save humanity, save the world and save themselves, in one of the most shocking tales ever told in the DC Universe.
                
                Fighting time, each other and all of humanity, Earth's greatest heroes must rally together for what may very well be their last chance to save the world from the most terrible plague humanity has ever seen. The Anti-Life Equation has been released and is ravaging the world at the viral speed of social media. Once exposed, victims lose their minds, violently attacking all around them.
                
                The heroes of Earth are fighting a losing battle to save the world...and themselves! With time running out, who will live and who will die in this apocalyptic tale of heroism, sacrifice and annihilation?</p>

                <p>"I'm more of a trade collector, but I had to get this issue by issue for spoilers and man oh man...it was a ride.

                    So the Anti-life equation is here in full force. Death is coming for ALL our heroes and we have very little time left. The first issue starts off vicious with plenty of characters getting killed off quickly. Batman has a plan but maybe the guy with ALL the plans won't have one this time...maybe just maybe...he's one of the first to go?
                    
                    Thinks are dire through this entire series but it does something so right that a lot of horror stories forget to do. Give us great characters. Make us FEEL when people die instead of just going "oh look at the cool kill" and Taylor nails it. Each character has their moment to shine but a lot of deaths hit hard because it's emotional. The art is also great with some horrifying deaths mixed with bombastic action.
                    
                    Really, DCeased is a rare mini that will be great for a lot of people. Love zombie type stories? This works well. Love DC characters? This will work well. Love great art mixed with wonderful character moments? This works even better. This is a must read this year IMO and a easy 5 out of 5.

                <p>"Tom Taylor seems to be DC's go to guy for longform Elseworlds versions of the DC universe. First there was Earth-2, then Injustice and Injustice 2, and now DCeased. But considering all of those were great and so is this, why mess with a good thing? Of course, this is going to be compared to books like Marvel Zombies. But that series quickly became goofy as hell. Taylor plays it straight here with lots of heart and even some bits of humor.

                    Taylor even comes up with a plausible way for this to all start by working in Darkseid's quest for the Anti-Life Equation. It gets corrupted while inserting it into Cyborg who spreads it across the internet, instantly infecting anyone who sees it turning them into zombies. From there, the heroes fight a losing battle as they struggle to save what remains of humanity.
                    
                    I typically like Trevor Hairsine's art. He brings a grit and detail to his artwork that I like. However here he's inked by longtime Walking Dead inker Stefano Guadiano and the art looks muddied, less defined. Still, the overall story carries it through any art complaints I had.
