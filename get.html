            <br>
            <p>
                To protect herself from her abusive adoptive family, an orphan mastered the act of being a gleeful and submissive daughter. When she dies in an accident, she believes that she is finally free. However, fate cannot be more cruel; she is reincarnated as Rudbeckia "Ruby" de Borgia, a minor villainess from a novel who grows up in a violent household and dies at the hands of her husband.

                Ruby's father, the power-hungry pope, wishes to ruin the Britanya Kingdom by marrying Ruby off to Britanya's mightiest knight, Iske van Omerta, and having her poison his beloved sister, Elenia. But Ruby knows his plan will ultimately fail, and no member of the Borgias family will escape Iske's wrath and revenge alive. In order to prove her innocence when the time comes, Ruby must act as an oblivious and docile wife, for only by winning her husband over can she hope to survive.            </p>

                    I recommend this to those who have the patience to witness characters evolve, for this narrative reflects the most human of traits—mistakes, learning, and the passage of time are all painstakingly portrayed. Within this work, nothing is different. The romance is poignant; the protagonist endures significant trials but also experiences moments of pure joy and deeply moving emotions that are truly rewarding.

                    But... I fail to comprehend!
                    
                    Truly, I cannot fathom those who do not recommend this Manwha! It stands as one of the finest, if not the very first masterpiece I encountered upon delving into the Manwha genre.
                    The artistry is exceptional, the strokes sublime, leaving one speechless; the characters are stunningly portrayed.                </p>

                    I felt the other review didn't really do this story much justice so wanted to add some thoughts. Keep in mind, I've only read what is translated of the manhwa so far, and it's based on a novel that is still being translated as well, I enjoyed this story enough I would read the novel - and honestly would probably enjoy it more.
