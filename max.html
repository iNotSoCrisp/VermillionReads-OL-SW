                Kang Jinhyeok, a gaming streamer and content creator, is the only person who has cleared the game "Tower of Trials." However, as the game's popularity declines, it becomes increasingly difficult for him to continue making a living as a content creator. Jinhyeok prepares to end his 11-year-long relationship with the game and say goodbye to his humble group of subscribers. But on that very day, the Tower of Trials appears in reality with a message saying that humanity will perish unless all players clear each floor within 90 days. Jinhyeok, who knows the game better than anyone, decides to use his knowledge to his advantage and dominate the tower. It's time to show everyone what a hardcore gamer can do!            </p>

                    This is your basic power fantasy manhwa with good art.

                    Story: 6/10
                    The usual 'video game becomes reality' type story with little to stand out. But that necessarily isn't that big of a drawback for readers who enjoy these types of stories (me). The lore/quests of the videogame are satisfactory enough.
                    
                    Art: 7/10
                    The art is great, that is probably the reason I still keep up with this manhwa. The action paneling is well done. The character designs of major characters are very basic though.
                    
                    Character: 6/10
                    I don't dislike our MC, nor do I really like him tbh. The rest of the characters are built on cliches, albeit being satisfactory for the plot.
                    
                    Enjoyment: 8/10
                    For someone who enjoys these types of stories, this was really enjoyable to read, but I hope the story takes a unique turn so that it can distinguish itself from the plethora of other similar manhwa.                </p>

                    Not an unique story, it pretty much feels like a mashup of Omniscient Reader & Solo Levelling. The author is here for showing us how the MC is so OP and badass and nothing more.
                    The only driving factor which let me read this manhwa is the art, which is by red-ice studio.
