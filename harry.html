                "Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter 'H'."

Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters start dropping on the doormat at number four, Privet Drive. Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt and uncle. Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure is about to begin!

                <p>I read this book a couple of years ago and, for some unknown reason, never continued on. It was just as wonderfully magical as I remembered, a breath of fresh air during what is usually a stressful time of year for me. I have yet to find a story that feels so pure and childlike that appeals to such a broad range of people. There’s something for everyone here; whether you are 10 or 100, Hogwarts is a place you can escape to and enjoy hearty adventures that you won’t find elsewhere.

                    I truly love all of the characters and feel the entire cast is well done, but my personal favorites are the Weasley twins, Hagrid, and Professor McGonnall. While I’ve seen all the movies and know the general storyline, I’m really excited to experience the story “first hand” and see what all was left out from the films. I’m also intrigued to find out more about each house, especially the ones that took a backseat in this story. Not sure if I can say anything that hasn’t been said before, but I loved it!

                <p>"As wonderful and magical as promised. Because I didn't remember the movie, the third act of the book was a delightful surprise to me.

                    I wish I'd had this book when I was a kid, because the idea that someone could be special without knowing it, and then get to visit a special world where the things that made him different were the same things that made him awesome would have been really inspiring to me.
                    
                    Anne's finishing this, too, and I have to wait for her before I start in on the second book ... HURRY UP ANNE!"</p>
