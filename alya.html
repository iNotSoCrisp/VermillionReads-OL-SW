            <p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Smart, refined, and strikingly gorgeous, half-Russian half-Japanese Alisa Mikhailovna Kujou is considered the idol of her school. With her long silver hair, mesmerizing blue eyes, and exceptionally fair skin, she has captured the hearts of countless male students while being highly admired by all others. Even so, due to her seemingly unapproachable persona, everyone remains wary around the near-flawless girl.

One of the few exceptions is Alisa's benchmate Masachika Kuze, a relatively average boy who spends his days watching anime and playing gacha games. Despite his nonchalant demeanor, Masachika is the sole student to receive Alisa's attention. Unable to be fully honest, Alisa is frequently harsh on Masachika and only expresses her affection in Russian. Unbeknownst to her, however, Masachika actually understands the language yet simply pretends otherwise for his own amusement.

As the odd pair continues to exchange witty and playful remarks, their relationship gradually grows more romantic and delightful—and Alisa might finally learn to freely convey her true feelings.</p>        </section>

                    With me,roshidere light novel is peak, it so interested,funny and romantic,character is unique, i love this light novel, The drawings are very beautiful, the situations are extremely funny :)).The characters interact with each other without being forced, but very natural and unique.I especially like the character kuze in the story, to me he is very cool and witty in his own thoughts.
                    It's too good for a newbie to light novels. I recommend you read it.I think you will definitely like it.
                    Even though it has an anime, the anime really doesn't do as well as its light novel, which makes me extremely disappointed, its anime only gets 7/10, the anime has some plots that are too fast forwarded And too forced, like the hypnosis scene In the light novel it seems interesting but in the anime it is something very boring, so I recommend you to read the light novel before watching the anime.                           </p>

                    This novel is not bad per say, if I was unfamiliar with japanese romcoms I’d even give this a 7, however Roshidere is just a reskin of a reskin of a reskin. Shitty tropes? Check. Garbage side characters? Check. Unoriginal? Check!

                    All you need to know before you read this is that you’re not getting anything new, if you like the standard japanese romcom then go and read it, however if you’re looking for an actual good novel, get off this website.
                    I will admit the authors writing is pretty good, however the plot is just not noteworthy, characters are bland and uninteresting, I’d even rate Tenshi-sama higher than this.                  </p>
