            <p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>In 1985, DC Comics dramatically altered comics' original universe with Crisis on Infinite Earths, a 12-issue series that rocked the comics community, tragically dooming some of DC's most beloved characters and drastically altering others. An unforgettable and defining event in comics history, Crisis was arguably the first companywide crossover to make good on its promise of lasting change.

                Written by Marv Wolfman and pencilled by George Pérez, with inks by Dick Giordano, Jerry Ordway, and Mike DeCarlo, Crisis on Infinite Earths finds the alternate worlds that once were a hallmark of the DC Universe under siege by a mysterious force powerful enough to wipe out the lives of billions.</p>

                <p>"This took me long enough. And it was the perfect comic to finish reading on my birthday ( hip hip hooray ).

                    I really don't know how to get into reviewing this. But the artwork was amazing (if you're into the older style of art). The dialogue flowed well. The plot... Oh, boy. The plot was amazing. Basically a positive matter being known as the Monitor is trying to keep an anti-matter being known as the Anti-Monitor from converting all matter into negative matter, thus destroying all earths. He destroys almost all of them, but the main five earths begin merging together. So the heroes (and even some villains at various points) have to come together and fight the Anti-Monitor.
                    
                    Overall, I think it accomplished it's goal of simplifying the DCU. But I was still left a little confused. For instance, how did four of my top five favorite DC characters die and come back to life years later? I'll have to peruse the Internet for that.
                    
                    I feel like reading this made me a genuine comic fan. I can understand that some people wouldn't like it, because it is VERY long and very confusing at times. But I really enjoyed this. And if you can stick it out for the first hundred pages or so, it will be worth it.

                <p>"What a classic of the superhero genre, truly getting your money's worth featuring every single DC character up to 1985 in what still hold's up as one of the most ambitious crossovers of all time.

                    I'd only recommend Crisis on Infinite Earths, however, for the true superhero aficionado. This is not an introductory course.
                    
                    Structurally this high-concept story doesn't make sense except steeped in the context of the already decades-old DC multiverse. But it's still a very fun ride.
                    
                    Monitor vs. Anti-Moniter, with every guest star ever. And, lastly, the art! George Perez is simply a legend."</p>
