            <br>
            <p>
                Be it throwing herself off her balcony, drinking poison, or even stabbing herself, Eris Miserian has attempted every means to end her miserable existence and return to her real home in South Korea. But—trapped within the confines of a novel she only skimmed through—Eris is denied death until she fulfills her purpose as a minor character, a mad villainess. There is not a single upside to her situation, as only people who eagerly anticipate her humiliation and suffering surround her.

                Instead of trying to change the course of the novel, Eris wholeheartedly embraces the role of a villainess. She wishes to perish and avoid reincarnation in this realm, hastening her return to her own reality. That is why she must let the novel's plot unfold and ultimately die by execution. In the meantime, she leverages her high social status to manipulate other characters and seek out those who can ensure her soul will be sent back to Korea. Even in the face of insurmountable plot restrictions, Eris intends to break every law to finally escape this wretched world.            </p>

                    This is undoubtedly one of the best manhwas that perfectly captures the characters' feelings. In my anime journey, where I have experience with over 600 series, this is one of the best. I think the character development is comparable to Violet Evergarden, if not better, because of such difficult topics as suicide, family and rape. I really liked the fact that the author showed not only dialogues, but a large part of them were the characters' thoughts. This is a big factor in why so many people can relate to the "antagonist", which comes down to a more enjoyable read.

                    Despite heavy topics and little reading (at least for me), the plot moves rather slowly, which allows you to fully focus on the characters' feelings. Their relationships are well handled and work well with the plot. Ending is really satysfying, though it didn't stop me from the desire to stay in bed for a month. Big advantage is that all threads are finished and nothing was left behind from the story of supporting characters.                </p>

                  "Story: Very interesting premise that stays captivating from start to finish. A lot of manhwas feel like a train on fire during their second half - not only is [Kill the Villainess] interesting at the start, I'd say it gets even more intense towards the end. I do have to warn you though - don't expect this story to be all rainbows and butterflies. It's a rather grim and heart wrenching read for the most past. I guarantee though that you'll love the ending.
