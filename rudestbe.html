                Shwetabh Gangwar is a professional problem-solver—and he’s ace at it. For the past five years, people from all over the world have contacted him with their troubles and he’s worked these out for them.

In the process, he has picked up on a simple pattern: people need a set of principles and perspectives to protect them from all the unnecessary bullshit they go through. Codes to live by, essentially.

But be warned: Gangwar has no desire to spare your feelings. What you will find in this straight-forward, straight-talking, no-craps-given guide, is:

How to deal with rejections of all kinds

How to change your perceptions of people so you don’t end up screwed

Why a society that sees people as ‘good and bad’ is dumb

How the search for happiness screws us over

How seeking approval and acceptance kills our individuality

The truth about social media influencers

Why we should be taught ‘how to think’, instead of ‘what to think’

Laying out clear principles, YouTube megastar Gangwar shows you how to deal with the shit that has happened to you, is happening to you and will happen to you.

A refreshing, easy-to-read, and relatable guide, The Rudest Book Ever will make you rethink everything you’ve been taught.

                <p>"Speaking about a vast majority of people, I think this book might be nothing short of a revelation. At first, you might think that the content provided in the book is blatantly obvious and you had known this all along. You might even think that you've wasted your money buying this and it's just one more addition to your run-of-the-mill self help books which uses cuss words for sounding smart/genuine just for the sake of it. A book which became a walloping bestsellers in the recent years comes to my mind (If you know what I mean).

                    But upon further examination, just when you might start to think that you have had enough of this, you come across something and go, "Hmm... Interesting. That's something that I've never thought about." You start thinking (which is what Shwetabh wanted all along) and come to a realisation that contrary to what you had been thinking all this time - the majority of notions that you claimed to have known all this time were actually a result of all the conditioning you have had in your life!"
                    
                    And to conclude, this book absolutely nails the job to perfection. Doesn't matter whether you're truly smart, intelligent, wise, clear headed (pick any word you can think), I think you should read this.
                    
                    Everyone will get something useful out of it."</p>
