            <br>
            <p>
                Duke Voreoti is the most terrifying man in the empire, with the coldest of demeanors and a gaze that can kill. But one day, he suddenly says that he wants to... adopt a child?! And that child is me?! After finding me at a shady orphanage, he whisked me away to his snowy palace without a second thought. Now I'm learning all the ways of the feared Voreoti family from his knights. However, things get dicey when the Duke becomes suspicious of my origins. With these fangs and jet black hair, perhaps we are more than just kindred spirits...

                    If you are looking for comedy and fuzzy warm vibes, this series is for you. While there's a background plot, the main focus is on father/daughter relationship. First three chapters are just setting up, and chapter 4 is where things start settling down. That should be a good point to decide if you like or hate this series.                </p>

                    The daughter father dynamic is so fresh and funny it feels like you are watching a comedy skit. We have none of that Japanese hesitance to right wrongs with vengeful fury. Both the father and daughter exact revenge swiftly and justly when needed and still have a loving household full of colorful characters and loving relationships.

                    THAT BEING SAID, besides the top tier writing for the characters that makes this feel so fresh its not really that special if you know the genre I'm referring too. The plot itself is a bit contrived and used, but its by no means bad. It just stands to reason that if it weren't for the characters this would be just another princess story filling the pile of stories in this genre I have already read.
