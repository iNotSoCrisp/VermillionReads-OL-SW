            <p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>One day, in the library where Sakuta Azusagawa studies, he runs into an unexpected sight: a beautiful high school girl in a bunny outfit. She turns out to be Mai Sakurajima, a famous former actress and fellow student at Minegahara High. His surprise at seeing Mai wear such risqué attire in the library, however, is nothing compared to the shocking realization that he is the only one who can see her!

                Reminded of an event from his past, Sakuta offers to help Mai discover the reason behind her invisibility. Despite their initially contentious relationship, the two quickly become close: Mai and Sakuta learn to appreciate each other, and their friendship turns into a budding romance. This further fuels their determination to solve Mai's dilemma.
                
                While the investigation progresses, Sakuta attributes Mai's situation to an urban legend known as Adolescence Syndrome: strange phenomena occurring in youth, unexplained by science and often dismissed as delusion. With few promising results, Mai's predicament worsens to the point where being unseen is the least of her worries. Can Sakuta and Mai solve the mystery of her Adolescence Syndrome before she disappears completely?</p>

                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★☆</p>
                <p>"I have read the first eight books, and I will say this series tells a coherent story throughout the books, and everything from the second book until the seventh book is linked so it is very difficult to judge the independent book, if we were to judge the entirety of the book.

                    The book deals with the independence of the high school kids, being under the environment social pressure, and eventually over coming the expectations of the ones they love. Their emotions are being torn apart, as the go through a troubling time, which all of them end up affecting the main character Sakuta. Which not only drives the story forward in a unforceful way, but helps Sakuta grow as he understands about himself and the ones he love and care.
                    
                    Also the writing style is very polished, as depiction and imagery is plentiful without being overly done and annoying like the light novels in the 2020s."</p>

                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★☆</p>
                <p>"Very well executed first 7 volumes which flounders thereafter.

                    This is a story about a man called Sakuta. He is not relevant to the series and is rather featureless, the story's main appeal is rather its use of mystery. Its ability to connect disparate events that are extended over its incredibly long first arc over its 7 volumes. Sakuta meets a mysterious high school student at a point where he's at his lowest. He applies to her school hoping to find her and she's not there. That's basically it.
                    
                    Unlike most light novels, the main conceit is not fully dealt with for several volumes. It lingers in the background unresolved, influencing various plots. This immediately makes it an achievement in the light novel space. What also sets it apart is its earnestness. It is not overly serious yet also fortunately not beckoned by irony and the prospect of being immune to criticism. Its biggest advantage is that it is also grounded, at no point does any spectacular feat of acrobatics or fight take place. This makes reading it a joy: conflict takes place in dialogue. It is also grounded in space, using real areas in the wider Tokyo metropolitan area by the sea side.
                    
                    What did make me quite sad was the story after the resolution of the first arc. It is clear only a vague vision existed for what should happen after the first arc. What was a very grounded and tightly written story was hurriedly repackaged and sown together to shove a quite unnecessary second plot which was just unneeded.
                    
                    To conclude, just read volume 1 to 7, and leave the series behind."
