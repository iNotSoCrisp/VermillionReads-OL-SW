            <p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Left rattled by the events of Dark Knights: Metal, Bruce Wayne must come face to face with the ultimate evil spawned from the Dark Multiverse. One part Batman one part Joker. The Batman Who Laughs.

                "A Batman who laughs is a Batman who always wins."
                
                The mastermind behind Dark Nights: Metal, Scott Snyder, gives you a look inside the most terrifying version of Batman ever! He and superstar artist Jock (Batman: The Black Mirror) kick off a chain of events that makes Dark Nights: Metal seem like child's play.
                
                The Batman Who Laughs not only survived his fight with The Joker at the end of Dark Nights: Metal, but is now enacting a sinister plan across the Multiverse--something both terrifying and oddly familiar. When Bruce Wayne realizes the only way to stop this madman is to kill him, he must consider violating the very rule Batman can't ever break ... the rule that created this insatiable villain--the Batman Who Laughs!
                
                As Bruce begins to deduce that his current life is somehow wrong and that all the mistakes he's made are somehow connected, the Batman Who Laughs unleashes a brand-new evil. Enter one of the most punishing Batmen of the Dark Multiverse: the Grim Knight!</p>

                <p>"This was amazing, easily my favorite of DC’s Black Label books that I’ve read. Scott Snyder has pulled off a wonderful magic trick with this story, distilling the true nature of Batman down to a perfect idea.

                    The art, storytelling, and everything about this was top notch. I love this heavy metal aesthetic and the dark themes of the book. If DC shut down everything else they’re doing and just did this kind of thing, I’d happily branch out into similar stories about Supes, Green Lantern, etc.

                <p>"I really- yes really like this run, in my opinion the writers understood what made batman work and took it apart to mess with it. A lot of writers tried to do the same and breath some fresh air into the batman IP but in most cases it ends up being a shitshow. So I get that some people dislike it, it makes bold moves with characters we've read about for decades.. It can't be everyone's cup of tea.

                    You could argue that its more style over substance and this overly gory horror version is just for looks .. even then you still can't deny how cool this is. The art is just awsome, at points the way they concealed characters in shadows could trade punches with mignola's way of doing that.
                    
                    I also really dug the batman beyond "easter egg". For me it just worked. 4.5 out of 5.0 stars"</p>
