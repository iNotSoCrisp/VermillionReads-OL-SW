            <br>
            <p>
                Rishe, the daughter of a duke, is stuck in a time loop that begins at the moment her engagement is annulled and ends with her early demise at the age of 20. She has now begun her seventh loop. In her past do-overs, Rishe experienced various occupations, including being a merchant, a pharmacist, and a knight. But this time around, she simply wishes to live a long and leisurely life!

That was the plan, only for it to be derailed by an unprecedented marriage proposal from her killer in the previous loop, the neighboring country's Crown Prince—?!</p>        </section>

                    In her 7th time loop, things are finally changing. After dying in various ways to prevent her death (which unfortunately failed), she's back at her 7th time loop, and is engaged to her enemy and killer, Arnold Hein, known to be a ruthless man.

                    Each volume focuses on one different story, so you'll see a new character (or a few) appearing in the story! You also get to see more of both Rishe and Arnold's emotions, but you also get to see them forming a closer bond with each other. A balance between romance and fantasy!                              </p>

                    In rofans, it usually involves supernatural elements, being reborn, etc. and this one includes our main character getting reborn of course, but it's different! It's much more slow paced but still as exciting. As someone who enjoys a fast pace every now and then, this was also enjoyable! Seeing them form a closer bond and seeing more of Arnold's emotions (volume 4 is currently at 4/10 of his emotions, according to the author) being revealed to the readers and Rishe is good enough for someone like me.
