            <p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>"Denji has a simple dream—to live a happy and peaceful life, spending time with a girl he likes. This is a far cry from reality, however, as Denji is forced by the yakuza into killing devils in order to pay off his crushing debts. Using his pet devil Pochita as a weapon, he is ready to do anything for a bit of cash.

                Unfortunately, he has outlived his usefulness and is murdered by a devil in contract with the yakuza. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Pochita merges with Denji's dead body and grants him the powers of a chainsaw devil. Now able to transform parts of his body into chainsaws, a revived Denji uses his new abilities to quickly and brutally dispatch his enemies. Catching the eye of the official devil hunters who arrive at the scene, he is offered work at the Public Safety Bureau as one of them. Now with the means to face even the toughest of enemies, Denji will stop at nothing to achieve his simple teenage dreams.

                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★☆</p>
                <p>"With less than 1,000 members and only one other review at the time of posting this, I thought I should write this so that more people will hopefully read it. This is my first review by the way!

                    Story - 8
                    The story is pretty simple so far, but that is not a bad thing! It's a shounen jump manga so fight scenes are frequent and there are comedic elements as well. What sets this manga apart though is the characters and the monsters. I'll elaborate on the characters in the "Character" section, but the monsters are really great. Because of the premise, there are pretty much endless possibilities for the bad guys in this manga. There are only 9 chapters out so far, and the story is still in the set-up phase, but I'm very excited to see where it goes.
                    
                    Art - 8
                    
                    Some people may not like the art style, but I love it. The more simplistic design allows the creative powers/monsters do be clearly drawn. You'll see early on what I'm talking about, and when Denji does use his powers, the art gets slightly more detailed and defined, and it looks really good. This manga is pretty much never visually boring, while still being easy to follow.
                    
                    Characters - 9
                    
                    Denji (the MC) is certainly unique for a shounen jump manga. He doesn't have any superficial ideals or an idol or hero he looks up to, but that didn't stop me from liking or caring about him. Not a jab at MHA or Naruto btw, but it's nice to see something different. The characters are great across the board, and blends some standard shounen tropes with a bit more realism. Like a lot of shounen protagonists, Denji has an unfortunate backstory, but it is addressed in a realistic manner that isn't superficial or character defining. He is completely his own person, and his character does not rely on him having a tough childhood or being poor. I initially thought that Power would be a nami clone of some sort, but this is quickly subverted as well.
                    
                    Enjoyment - 9
                    
                    I wish this had more chapters I could read. This manga is lots of fun to consume, and it has a perfect mix of realistic characters, great action scenes, and true originality. I can't wait to read more as it comes out!

                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★☆☆</p>
                <p>"I've heard alot of good things about this manga and now that it has finally ended I sat down and read it all in one sitting, surprisingly this did not take much time even though there are 97 chapters the majority of the work is textless whereas some chapters of manga can take upwards of 10 minutes to read due to how dense they are CSM is the complete opposite.

                    The art and concept are very cool, never saw anything like it before. The problem with this manga is it does not at all live up to the hype I do not understand why its so widely regarded as good.
                    
                    The story meanders and is all over the place. I was finally getting into the arc with Reze and then I got completely lost, it's incredibly difficult to piece together what is going on and follow along, the writing is just all over the place it feels like entire chapters are skipped with how much the story jumps around. The conclusion of a massive arc with all the build up is done in the course of one chapter, nothing is ever appropriately explained, characters completely change motivations and attitude the rules set up prior are completely broken. One of the arcs has an idea and villain introduced in one chapter only to never be brought up again, if you removed the chapter from the series the it would have no effect on the work as a whole.
                    
                    There was never a power dynamic set up or explained, there are no ways to judge the strength of any of the devils, and there aren't enough battles to even have the kind of growth Denji has in power. Above all else there are no stakes, there is no fear of Denji dying at any point in the series because he just always wins. Why? Just cause. Even bleach had some kind of hamfisted explanation for a random powerup, this manga doesn't even attempt to do that.
                    
                    Ok so the art is great, maybe that is why people like it. Despite the art being at a high level, the design and layout of the manga make it difficult to even tell what is going on, there is barely any variation in the design of the devils so the fighting scenes are actually the worst part of this manga, its like trying to extract meaning from modern art which is some squidward looking chick bleeding and shitting on an easel. Couple this bizarre artistic direction with the continual skips and paradigm shifts in the story and it really doesn't become worth reading when you have the option to do something else with your time.
                    
                    In the end, CSM is okay, its not a 10 and its certainly not a 1. It's just ok. I probably would have dropped it had it not been so widely regarded as good. Even memekina isn't that great of a character or even fleshed out in the story. Maybe part 2 will be more coherent, I will not be going on that journey though thanks.
