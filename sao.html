            <br>
            <p>In the year 2022, gamers rejoice as Sword Art Online-a VRMMORPG (Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) like no other-opens its virtual doors, allowing players to take full advantage of the ultimate in gaming technology: NerveGear, a system that allows users to completely immerse themselves in the game world by manipulating their brain waves to create a wholly realistic gaming experience. But when the game goes live, the elation of the players quickly turns to horror as they discover that, for all its amazing features, SAO is missing one of the most basic functions of any MMORPG-a log-out button. Now trapped in the virtual world of Aincrad, their bodies held captive by NerveGear in the real world, users are issued a chilling ultimatum: conquer all one hundred floors of Aincrad to regain your freedom. But in the warped world of SAO, "game over" means certain death-both virtual and real...

                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★☆</p>
                <p>"As a native speaker of mandarin, i am lucky enough to enjoy the novels without needing to wait the long translation time or the english translation of the book. Although the first story about Aincrad have seem to be unorganized and messy in structure due to its original purpose is for a novel contest, the story construction skills of Reki Kawahara is something that is definitely worth praising. Both the ALO arc and GGO arc provided a thorough and organized storyline, that are easy to read, understand, and enjoy. Kawahara together with his incredible skills of building tensions and setting the mood while reading, shown in book 7 (mother's rosario) cause the story to be attractive for readers that doesn't reject sci-fi or fantasy stories since the whole timeline is based on future with currently undeveloped technology.

                    The illustrator abec's work is fantastic, with each page of illustration builds up and add on to the feelings or mood that Kawahara wants to present, like the illustration for return of Kirito at the near end of the UW arc, and the scene of Yuuki laying in Asuna's lap at the end of Mother's Rosario.
                    
                    For english readers that are still waiting for translation of the Alicization/UW arc, the story is definitely worth the wait. The whole arc could be a master piece in the category of light novel. The complicated yet understandable setting and plot connected with the illustrations of abec is just pure enjoyments when reading.
                    
                    Reading this arc was so enjoying that i wouldve want a brain wash so i can re-read the series again."</p>

                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★☆</p>
                <p>"Alright so first, this is my first review and never less I'm doing this on a phone, so hand with me here. Do let's get started,
                    First, the story, the story has a great plot line while being the smartest novel, I've read. It goes into full Detail behind how the virtual reality in the story works.the theory on sword art's VR is plausible and bring a the reader I on a whole new level.add the story goes on the plot line gets even more smart and interesting in the alicization arcs,( I think I spelled that right) which introduces more technology and goes more in depth in the world were the protagonist lives in. In general the story is a good 9.
                    Secondly, the art in the novel it's great but there is not a lot of it, it's done by a didn't person them the author, which goes the name of "abec".the art is great but not consistent, which is expected of a light novel. All in all the art is a good 8.
                    Thirdly, the characters. The characters have a mix review because only the main characters have a deep personality, side characters that only show up for a couple of chapters don't show much personality. enemies of the protagonist are an exception as they sometimes will have background sorry. The main characters on the other hand have at least an individual trait that makes them who they are. kirigaya kazuto aka kirito (the protagonist) has a trait of not showing off and keeping everything a secret unless asked about it or when it process top be useful. In the end the character eating is a fair 6.
                    Next, my personal enjoyment. I enjoyed this series very much and hope to continue that the next book will be on par our better then the last. the series had by far kept me joined the longest from it giving me a picture of what's happening and appeals greatly to the five senses. Over all this has been a great and fun ride so far which deserves a 9.
                    Lastly, the over all grade I give this series of novels is a nine for a intelligent plot line and for a stores that produces great sensory images.this sunni and I recommend this novel to anyone who wants to see some action and intelligent story."
