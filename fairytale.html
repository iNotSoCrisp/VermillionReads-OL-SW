            <p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>In the mystical realm of Earth Land, magic exists at the core of everyday life for its inhabitants, from transportation to utilities and everything in between. However, even with all its benefits, magic can also be used for great evil; therefore, to prevent dark forces from upsetting the natural order of things, there exists a system of magical guilds in the Kingdom of Fiore. Under the command of their respective guild masters, these guilds are made up of witches and wizards who take on various job requests to earn fame and fortune. One particular guild stands high above the rest in both strength and spirit, and its name is Fairy Tail.

                In his quest to find his dragon foster father—Igneel—Natsu Dragneel, a fiery and reckless mage, and his partner Happy run into a young celestial mage by the name of Lucy Heartfilia, who reveals that it is her dream to become a full-fledged wizard and join the Fairy Tail guild. After rescuing her from an abduction attempt, Natsu offers her a home in Fairy Tail. Now a member of the guild, Lucy teams up with Natsu and befriends fellow wizards Gray Fullbuster and Erza "Titania" Scarlet. Together, this motley crew set out on their many adventures, gaining many faithful allies and deadly foes along the way.</p>

                <p>"A replica of One Piece? Seems like it
                    Worth reading? Yes
                    
                    Fairy Tail undertakes another fantasy setting. I have always been skeptic of fantasy anime's as most of them is always obscure, and prone to be uninteresting as the story progresses. But that mistake isnt repeated here in Fairy Tail as Hiro Mashima performs excellent on making his own fantasy world out of thin air.
                    
                    In this manga, all sorts of mages roam about the world. Some of them even bond together and form a guild that takes requests from people in exchange for money, there are even such guilds that are &quot;dark&quot;, who are not among the law-abiding. Fairy Tail is among the hundred of guilds out there. But unlike the general they, to quote their master&quot; do what you think is right&quot;. Yes, they do what they believe they should be doing, all for the sake of just finishing a job. Whether its wrecking a house to turning a whole town into a scrapyard, it doesnt matter for them, as long as they get the job done.
                    
                    Fairy Tail tells the story of Dragonil Natsu, a Fire Mage who was raised by an ancient fire-breathing dragon. and his newfound friend Lucy, a Spirit Mage who's pretty much new on the world of guilds. Together they and the rest of the members of the Fairy Tail guild goes through all sorts of adventures.
                    
                    At first glance, it may sound lame because of how it follows the monster-of-the-week formula. And yes it does. But dont let that stop you from reading this. Sure it is pretty much follows a shounen formula. But to my surprise, the plot twists were variable. I am constantly impressed on how detailed the arcs were. They start out as something terribly cliche then suddenly turn out to something unexpected. Furthermore, each character is connected to each other and each of their past is no exception either. I love how every character is significant to further progress the story.
                    
                    The art during action scenes is very impressive. It is comprehensive. You can understand what is happening to the characters and around them. At some climactic parts, I even got around to get my Ipod to listen to some One Piece Soundtrack while I was reading. Surprisingly, the music pays off. It gave a better atmosphere and it invigorated me. Another plus is it doesnt fill the panels with unnecessary captions. But it never forgets to show the reaction of each character in the scene. And most of those reactions are just plain humorous. And each character design is likable, as every male boasts their six-packs and every female shows their cleavage.
                    
                    Fairy Tail will not fail to deliver its action packed, slapstick comedy to its readers.
                    If that sounds good to you then dont you even dare to miss out on Fairy Tail.

                <p>"I first started Fairy Tail because all my friends were like: &quot;You love One Piece, you'll LOVE this!&quot; I thought it would be a rip-off of my favorite series and went into it with very low expectations. However, only a few chapters in, my attitude changed significantly!

                    This series is reasonably new so the story is only just started, however what there is so far is great! A lot is still open and YET TO HAPPEN and I find myself excited to find out what happens next. The jokes are original and don't get stale and the overall tone of the series is a very fun one.
                    
                    Each character you come into contact with is unique and interesting. Most of them have a quirk that will have you laughing. There's the chronic-stripper Gray and the motion-sickness prone Natsu. Not to forget Elfman who practically walks around spouting Chuck Norris quotes. This series has strong female characters and wonderful male characters! And let's not forget the token animal characters.
                    
                    I love the art style. It's clean and the characters have very distinct facial expressions. At first glance, it looks like a One Piece rip-off. While the styles are very similar, you will be soon to realize that the art styles are very different!
                    
                    The tone of this series is light-hearted and hilarious. Like all series, it has its serious moments that are very well done. I'd sit here and tell you all about the series but I think you should see for yourself! It's worth giving a shot!"</p>
