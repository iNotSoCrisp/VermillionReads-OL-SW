            <p>The world we knew is gone.

                How many hours are in a day when you don't spend half of them watching television? When is the last time any of us really worked to get something we wanted? How long has it been since any of us really needed something that we wanted?
                
                The world of commerce and frivolous necessity has been replaced by a world of survival and responsibility. An epidemic of apocalyptic proportions has swept the globe, causing the dead to rise and feed on the living.
                
                In a matter of months society has crumbled: no government, no grocery stores, no mail delivery, no cable TV. In a world ruled by the dead, the survivors are forced to finally start living.
                
                Rick Grimes finds himself one of the few survivors in this terrifying future. A couple months ago he was a small town cop who had never fired a shot and only ever saw one dead body. Separated from his family, he must now sort through all the death and confusion to try and find his wife and son.

                <p>Honestly, I'm probably the one person on the planet that hasn't watched much of the TV show but I was surprised at how much more quickly things in the comic happen. I feel like season one was probably Vol. 1 and 2 combined. Rule number one for reading this: Do not get attached to any of the characters! At least one person dies in each one, at least they do in the first three volumes, and in most cases it's 2 or more deaths per volume. You can like or dislike characters but do not get attached. At least it's realistic that way. It's definitely gritty, brutal, and more down to earth than a lot of zombie stuff I've seen. Most of the characters are easy to like but the main character's wife is a real piece of work. I absolutely despise her. The art is really good. It is black and white though, which is fine, but I would be interested to see it in color, considering how gory it can be. I definitely like the story, and will continue with the series. I'm glad I found a good horror graphic novel that has a lot of volumes and is still ongoing. Now I'm onward to the next.</p>

                <p>Oh yeah......I'm in. "The world we knew was gone."
                    As it begins, the gunslinging Officer Rick Grimes, hurt in the line of duty, wakes up alone....well almost alone in the hospital. No wife and no best friend-partner watching over him; no nurse or anyone answers his call, and then he finds some of them and realizes the world is not the same.
                    
                    THE WALKING DEAD comic graphic novel was a quick way to introduce me to the story that family and friends have recommended to me for years....and now I'm hooked too!
                    
                    Confession....I've spent the last nine days binge watching all eight seasons of the AMC series and have found a very addictive character-driven story of survival. Yes, there's a ton of blood and gore and evil types that do even worse deeds than the walkers, but great entertainment nonetheless as a catastrophic epidemic sweeps the country causing the dead to feed on the living.
                    
                    Noted some differences comparing novel to series even in this first volume. Can't wait to read and watch more!</p>
