                How will Artificial Intelligence affect crime, war, justice, jobs, society and our very sense of being human? The rise of AI has the potential to transform our future more than any other technology--and there's nobody better qualified or situated to explore that future than Max Tegmark, an MIT professor who's helped mainstream research on how to keep AI beneficial.

How can we grow our prosperity through automation without leaving people lacking income or purpose? What career advice should we give today's kids? How can we make future AI systems more robust, so that they do what we want without crashing, malfunctioning or getting hacked? Should we fear an arms race in lethal autonomous weapons? Will machines eventually outsmart us at all tasks, replacing humans on the job market and perhaps altogether? Will AI help life flourish like never before or give us more power than we can handle?

What sort of future do you want? This book empowers you to join what may be the most important conversation of our time. It doesn't shy away from the full range of viewpoints or from the most controversial issues--from superintelligence to meaning, consciousness and the ultimate physical limits on life in the cosmos.

                <p>So, I‘m new to AI and even though I do know some technical stuff, I‘m no professional. I got this book because I am interested in AI and what possibilities there are for our life. Even though some parts of the book were repetitive, it provided a good summary and outlook about AI and the effect on our life.

                    The book was neatly organized and gave good summaries about each chapter. The author did a good job in guiding the reader through the technological landscape and the images were well embedded into the text.
                    If you are into this theme and always wanted to get a rough overview, I would recommend this book. As it is always the case with non-fiction, I also recommend to read/get perspectives from other AI professionals as well, which I will do as next steps.

                <p>"This is a very interesting and thought-provoking book.

                    The author has written a compelling challenge analysis of the choices facing us as we create ever more powerful A.I. super-computers; will they usher in a new era – or will they replace us?
                    
                    This is a tale about our own future with Artificial Intelligence.
                    
                    The book does not offer all the answers but makes the reader think.
                    
                    It's highly engaging and possibly the best book on AI out there right now.
