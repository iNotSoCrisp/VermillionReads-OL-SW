            <p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Exiting the convenience store, Subaru Natsuki emerges to a busy town inhabited by humans and demi-humans. Using dragons and carriages as transportation, the town is clearly not the modern-day Japan that he is familiar with. However, as someone who spends his days engrossed in comics and games, Subaru assumes that he is a protagonist in this new fantasy world, harnessing supreme magical powers.

                Much to his dismay, that is not the case and things quickly go awry as he bumps into a group of thugs. Fortunately, a silver-haired beauty named Satella comes to his rescue, while looking for her stolen insignia. In return for her kindness, Subaru offers to help with the search, which eventually leads them to a loot shop. Assuming that the insignia was traded for money, Subaru enters the shop hoping to negotiate with the owner regarding the stolen item. However, much to his surprise, what awaits them is not the insignia but a brutal assassin that leads the two to their demise.
                
                But instead of waking up in the afterlife, Subaru is shocked to find himself standing alone in the midst of daytime, as if he never left the town in the first place. Thus, his life in another world mysteriously begins a second time.</p>        </section>

                    Anyone hoping for something quickly gratifying will not find it with Re:Zero. The story is very slow to progress. In fact, 15 volumes in, and questions we’ve been asking since chapter 1 have yet to be answered. On the contrary, it is at a faster pace that more questions are added than answered. However, that’s not to say that it wastes time or fails to provide information. In fact, it does a marvelous job of ensuring that every chapter is a necessary inclusion. (Mayo on the side) This story is one to be savored, and I dread the day that it wraps itself up.               </p>

                    Natsuki Subaru is a flawed character; and that is intentional. You may get impatient, and you may facepalm in disgust, but there are real consequences for his personality failures, and like anyone who grapples with their own shortcomings, he will struggle and adjust in order continue on for himself and the people he cares for. Be ready to suffer and struggle with him. He very much progresses from the person he starts out being.

                    The other characters naturally endure their own faults. However, that does not necessarily mean you won’t find them charming or enjoyable. Re:Zero does a very good job with showing how changes in environment or knowledge can alter a character’s reactions and priorities. It fleshes out the supporting characters’ dispositions, and allows the reader to truly understand who they are and why.
                    There are exceptions to this, but for the most part, every character introduced in the story is cherished by the author, and breathed life into.
