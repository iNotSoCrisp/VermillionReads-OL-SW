            <p><strong>The content of The Metamorphosis:</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>
                "As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect. He was laying on his hard, as it were armor-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he could see his domelike brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes."

                With it's startling, bizarre, yet surprisingly funny first opening, Kafka begins his masterpiece, The Metamorphosis. It is the story of a young man who, transformed overnight into a giant beetle-like insect, becomes an object of disgrace to his family, an outsider in his own home, a quintessentially alienated man. A harrowing‚Äîthough absurdly comic‚Äîmeditation on human feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, The Metamorphosis has taken its place as one of the most widely read and influential works of twentieth-century fiction. As W.H. Auden wrote, "Kafka is important to us because his predicament is the predicament of modern man."

                <p>" really struggled with this review for a while, but however unimpressed I was with the story at first, it wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone. The more I thought about it, the more it bugged me, so I guess, in the end, it did leave an impression, even if a rather frustrating one. The more I looked back at the text, the more I saw its, yes, brilliance." </p>
