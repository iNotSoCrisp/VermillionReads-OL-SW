            <p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>On the massive island called the Academy, students compete in star-hunting Games to advance their ranks. And among the many competitors, none is better than Sarasa Saionji, the Seven Star Empress. At least, not until unranked newcomer Hiroto Shinohara beats her by accident. To protect himself and the status quo, Hiroto must fool everyone into thinking he’s the new top student despite almost failing his entrance exam. Will he be able to keep this lie going when every student on the island wants to take him down?

                <p>"The story goes back to one of the most prestigious schools in Japan where there is a peculiar star-based ranking system that you can earn with your course grades or by playing game matches against other students. Our protagonist has a fight with the Empress of the school, the unbeatable, and ends up winning causing a lot of problems and seizing the title of 7 stars (the highest classification) because of an accident. Shinohara will have to defend this title without having the ability to possess it but with the help of being able to cheat. It is an interesting premise and it develops well during the course of the first volume, and on top of it it is easy to understand so you will immediately delve into the story feeling part of it. The only two criticisms I have about this section are that sometimes the story can get a bit repetitive and that it is similar in many ways to Classroom of the Elite (Novel).

                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★☆☆</p>
                <p>"Art is perhaps the weakest part of the Novel, the art of the novel is simple, it is not very detailed and in some cases it may seem incomprehensible, I give you an example, in the first chapter Saionji is described as a girl more Beautiful than Kawaii and in the drawing she appears looking small and Kawaii, but she did not command respect as they had described. Apart from that there is a chapter without any drawings and that seems wrong to me since unimaginative viewers need a sufficient number of drawings to imagine the situation, not even 1 drawing per chapter."
