                In this world where Hunters with various magical powers battle monsters from invading the defenceless humanity, Sung Jin-Woo was the weakest of all the Hunters, barely able to make a living.

                <p>"Js finished binge reading , it’s currently 6:54 am 4 days later (I had work and slept to so I basically took breaks) it ws really good but would’ve been a better experience if freaking smish swish wouldn’t spoil almost every single chapter , I wanted to stop reading the comments but I wanted to see if other readers were feeling the same way but then I see a spoiler that ws literally so uncalled for like BRO keep ur bigass mouth shut PLSS I like a little spoiler but the huge ones made me less hyped than how other ppl were in the comments and I wish I could feel it to so I recommend NOT reading the comments until after the first season cs the second season the comments don’t spoil as much or at all anymore if I remembered it right , im not gonna make any summaries but I’d rate it a solid 9/10 and the art is chefs kiss fr tbh it wasn’t my cup of tea at first but it got better and better and abs..I mean better , now I’m off to binge watch the anime…after finishing spyxfamily and after I sleep and after work"</p>

                <p>"It was amazing the art was great, story was awesome the best thing I have ever read (I’ve been reading for about 2 yrs now) 11/10 if you see smish swish or some name like that in the fore 105 chapters it is most likely a spoiler so try to avoid reading smish swish’s comments"</p>
