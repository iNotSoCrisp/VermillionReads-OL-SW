                Yggdrasil is a virtual reality game renowned for the freedom it offers its players. After a simple tutorial, players are left to explore the world and can customize anything and everything, from their classes to their weapons. However, in the year 2138, the game sees its final hours as its servers shut down at midnight.

                Momonga, a devoted player of Yggdrasil, decides to spend the game's last hours inside his guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. Strangely, at the stroke of midnight, the game does not log him out. Instead, Momonga finds himself transported to another world, one that is seemingly identical to that of Yggdrasil. Facing an already abnormal situation, he discovers that the NPCs have gained sentience.
                
                Trapped in his avatar's skeletal body and desperate to uncover the cause of his predicament and find other players like him, Momonga sets out to take control of the new world with the help of his loyal subjects.        </section>

I used to not like reading, but when you watch a show that is so good and enjoyable you want to read the source material. It really makes you want to know more. I used to need to see stuff playing like shows, movies, or at the very least visual comics, or so I thought because when reading the actual source materials for these shows I was very engrossed into everything and everything is more in detail. The world building and characters in OVERLORD go in depth and are entertaining to the point you could sit there and read these characters doing nothing for an hour but talk and it would still be interesting seeing them interact with one another. The world building in this is absolutely amazing and detailed. While this novel is not primarily an action novel, when there are fights with the main characters and the world, It always is amazing. Overall this is definitely one of my favorite reads and is definitely a great piece of fiction.

                    Bruh what can I say about Overlord that hasn't already been said? This is about everything I'd want out of a story of this nature. But for this review, I want to focus on something most people probably wouldn't give so much attention to in this story: comedy.

                    I'll admit, the comedy isn't a huge part of it but for me really adds to my enjoyment. Overlord, in its real sense, is an ironic comedy and does a fantastic job of showing it through Ain's (Momonga) character. This guy has to be the luckiest man alive. He's about average intelligence and highly over or under complicates things; so much so that he has hardly an idea what's going on most of the time. His closest subordinates are coming up with so many big brain plays all the time and Ain's just has no clue what's going on. In spite of this, his suboridents loyalty and admiration run so deep they are essentially blind to all his weaknesses and believe he himself is the ultimate big brain. WHAT GENIOUS IRONY.
