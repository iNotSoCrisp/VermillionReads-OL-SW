                    One of the best murim manhwa I've had the pleasure of reading alongside Return of the Blossoming Blade and The Legend of the Northern Blade.

                    Story: 8/10
                    The story your classic murim manhwa plot. As the mc progresses, he meets stronger enemies and gets stronger. The incorporation of SciFi in the murim genre is something unique to this manhwa. The lore is good enough as well. The politics are interesting, but nothing is more enjoyable than watching our mc get better as time moves on.
                    
                    Art: 9/10
                    Absolutely outstanding. The action paneling is amazing, and the colors and shades used bring out the action as well. The only thing I would criticize is some character designs, but that is a minor issue since the main characters are designed satisfactorily.
                    
                    Character: 10/10
                    The antagonists are very typically written but this manhwa is like junk food, so I don't really mind them. The MC is someone that the audience enjoys watching and reading.
                    His personality is neither too likable nor too undesirable, there exists a good balance.                </p>

                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★☆☆</p>
                <p>
                    A martial arts manhwa with a good concept and solid art. It starts off decent and then really picks up the steam only to falter in the latter parts. It goes from an interesting and engaging revenge plot to a generic power fantasy with an OP Mc whos much crueler than your typical lead. The latter part has zero-character growth for side characters barring power ups and a random unexplained shift the MC's personality. But the action and art are still good.
                    I'm not sure whether to recommend it or not.
                    
                    Score for the first 100-150 chapters: 8.5
                    Score for the chapters beyond that: 6.5
