            <br>
            <p>
                Park Hyung Suk has spent all 17 years of his life at the bottom of the food chain. Short, overweight, and unattractive, he is used to being bullied by his classmates and constantly discriminated against for his looks. In an attempt to escape his biggest bully, Lee Tae Sung, he decides to transfer to Seoul's Jae Won High School, a vocational preparatory school notorious for its liberal education system and carefree students.

                Days before his transfer, Hyung Suk wakes to find that he is no longer in his usual chubby body, but is instead in a perfect body! Tall, handsome, and beautifully toned, Hyung Suk has become the ideal version of himself. The only problem is that his original body still lays beside him—and when one body falls asleep, he awakens in the other.
                
                Now possessing two extremely different bodies, Hyung Suk must learn to navigate his new and much more popular life at J High whilst also solving the mystery of where his second, almost superhuman, body came from.            </p>

                    The story is really great because it has true topics that nobody speaks so openly about them, like the discrimination to other people for their experience, bully abuse, the pressure of the social media nowadays and others. This story has drama, comedy, mystery and some chapters are even wicked.
                    
                    The characters are developed so good because each one of them have an important role in the story, even the bad ones has a good background story and with the story progress you can understand more about their actions.

                    Lookism was great, but all I remember now is its wasted potential. TL;DR at bottom
                    
                    I used to love Lookism, so much so that I would recommend it to all of my friends who liked Webtoons. It had a unique concept, and it acted as a form of social commentary on "lookism," or discrimination on the basis of looks, while still being an entertaining series with a colourful cast of mostly likable characters. If my score was based on my original opinion, I would've easily given the series at least an 8/10, so why do I give it a 5?"</p>
