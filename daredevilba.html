            <br>
            <p>In this larger-than-life theater, the forces of corruption and redemption have at one another with a Wagnerian intensity that rivals the very best this medium has ever produced. At stake - one man's immortal, indestructible soul.

                <p>""A man without hope is a man without fear."

                    If you're new to Daredevil then don't start with this book, go back to Frank Miller and Klaus Janson's Daredevil Visionaries Volume 2, #168-182. Then read Volume 3, #183-191. Then read this. Then read Man Without Fear. You're welcome.
                    
                    David Mazzucchelli is a talented and now almost forgotten illustrator. Like Batman Year One, his splash pages are incredible, his action swift and evocative, his faces realistically emotive. His style is epic, effortless, and highly dramatic. And he's one of, if not the, greatest of 80s illustrators.
                    
                    When I first read this I didn't get it because I had no backstory. You can't appreciate a character's downturn if you don't know who they are. After learning about Matt and Heather, Elektra, Bullseye, Kingpin, Foggy Nelson, and the politics of Hell's Kitchen, Born Again is a master stroke of grit, characterization, and drama. This is one of the greatest revenge and comeback stories I've ever read.

                <p>"Wilson Fisk can't defeat Daredevil but he might break down Matt Murdock.
                    Excellent storytelling.
                    
                    A very dark tale by Miller who was on top of his game back then. The first couple of issues are absolutely brilliant, the quality drops a bit in the last couple of issues, but overall 'Born again' is a great story."</p>
