                <p>"The story is very similar to its predecessor in the holistic sense, blame it to the prequel's horrible ending of everyone forgetting about everything. Well let's not go to that aspect. This one expands in on the story left behind by the saga of Jin Woo. The story now focuses on our protagonist Sung Suho, the son of Jin Woo. He has innate powers of the Shadow Monarch so it makes him pretty busted and a bit less interesting to watch. The immediate evil here is now Itarim as opposed to the Monarchs. So you can witness a little tweak here and there in the story but the overall structure is still similar, you are the weakest player but only you have the power to level up. The story relies a bit too much on the plot armour and the survival aspect of the original being missing dissapoints me, as that was arguably the best part. So it is now purely action fantasy. But still it does not prevent it from being a fun little read. The action is top notch, art is still better than almost the entirety, the story is still fun to read, it has still got its humorous tones, the characters are also good, where seeing past characters genuinely puts me on a simle. So I see plenty good reasons for you to read this. Only time will tell if it will live up to its expectations."</p>

                <p>"At first, you will think the pacing of this manhwa is fast but believe me , the pacing of this manhwa will become really stable as the series progresses and you will love it.
                    The first arc of this manhwa needs fast pacing to develop the next arcs of this manhwa perfectly.
                    All the arcs of this Webnovel is perfect and really enjoyable.
                    
                    The art is great as always.
                    I can say it without any hesitation that Solo Leveling Ragnarok Webnovel is even better than Omniscient reader's viewpoint webnovel.
                    At first I also didn't believed that they can write this manhwa this much perfectly.."</p>
