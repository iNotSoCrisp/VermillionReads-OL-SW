            <br>
            <p>
                Shadowbrokers are those who go unnoticed, posing as unremarkable people, when in truth, they control everything from behind the scenes. Sid wants to be someone just like that more than anything, and something as insignificant as boring reality isn't going to get in his way! He trains in secret every single night, preparing for his eventual rise to power—only to denied his destiny by a run-of-the-mill (yet deadly) traffic accident. But when he wakes up in a another world and suddenly finds himself at the head of an actual secret organization doing battle with evil in the shadows, he'll finally get a chance to act out all of his delusional fantasies!        </section>

                    Is there much more to say other than it is a Power fantasy that is also an Isekai where the MC has black hair and is edgy? Yes, and its the reason I think this story will evolve past a Light Novel and Manga Adaptation.

Looking at this story for the first time it was clear to see what it was going for. It's an Isekai; guy dies, gets reincarnated with his old memories, tries to become more powerful. Its the most simple rinse and repeat pattern with a lot of modern Isekai that are coming out. There is only so much a story can evolve from after this point, with the most usual path being to become the Hero and slay the Demon Lord. But within "The Eminence in Shadows" the story is already changed from the start.

                    This story at first glance seems to be your typical fantasy read. However, there is much more to it that meets the eye. The story is intriguing, with the general "MC Wants To Hide Their Power" being remade to a new tier/level of storytelling. It exhibits its indivisuality and uniqueness through its art and characters.

The story is based around the MC's group, "Shadow Garden", which is sort of a vigilante group seeking to protect peace. The series has a fair share of action and comedy-the comedy part is that people think the MC is a mastermind genius;while in fact he does things randomly at times and has no particular reason for it.
