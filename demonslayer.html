            <p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Tanjirou Kamado lives with his impoverished family on a remote mountain. As the oldest sibling, he took upon the responsibility of ensuring his family's livelihood after the death of his father. On a cold winter day, he goes down to the local village in order to sell some charcoal. As dusk falls, he is forced to spend the night in the house of a curious man who cautions him of strange creatures that roam the night: malevolent demons who crave human flesh.

                When he finally makes his way home, Tanjirou's worst nightmare comes true. His entire family has been brutally slaughtered with the sole exception of his sister Nezuko, who has turned into a flesh-eating demon. Engulfed in hatred and despair, Tanjirou desperately tries to stop Nezuko from attacking other people, setting out on a journey to avenge his family and find a way to turn his beloved sister back into a human.</p>

                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★☆</p>
                <p>"I would say that the enjoyment and character aspect of this series bumps up the 9 in both the art and story category, hence the 10/10 overall rating. This is a manga I would recommend to anybody who likes action or cool characters. I am extremely happy that a studio as great as ufotable is doing a FAITHFUL adaptation (let alone such a high quality adaptation) to this great manga. This fact gives me another reason to recommend this manga to people, because the quality of the animation is so high, even if you read this manga you will still look forward to seeing these amazing fights animated. I know a lot of people don't read manga so they can just watch the anime, but with Kimetsu no Yaiba I fully believe that it is worth it to read it first so you can enjoy it more for the characters and the story and then you can watch it after for the art and the fighting.

                    If you like action and/or a great story with great characters, do yourself a favor and read Demon Slayer.

                <p>"Kimetsu no yaiba is the kind of manga that starts off slow, you feel like the author doesn't know what to do, but picks up later on when the mangaka introduces other characters, the characters are ALL lovable seriously! and Tanjiro's personality is not really your typical shonen stuff he's kindhearted and super sweet not hotblooded and impulsive, another good thing is the female characters they're all likeable and useful for a change i really like Nezuko and their brother-sister bond, as for the art many have commented that the characters sometimes look derpy but that's not bad either because it suits the funny moments. Conclusion: give it a chance !"</p>
