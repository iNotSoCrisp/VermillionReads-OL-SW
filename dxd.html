            <br>
            <p>Perverted youth Issei Hyoudou's dreams seem to come true when the beautiful Yuuma Amano asks him out on a date. But when she reveals her identity as a fallen angel and tries to kill Issei, his death seems imminent—until an upperclassman named Rias Gremory rescues him. When he wakes up again, she reveals herself to be a devil. In order to save Issei, she reincarnated him as one of her kind, making him her new servant.

                This turn of events thrusts Issei into the world of the supernatural. As he is introduced to the various devils in the Occult Research Club at his high school, he must learn to adapt to this new world filled with devils and fallen angels. Setting his sights on becoming powerful, he must decide what is truly important to him as he comes to realize that the life of a devil is not an easy one.

                <p>"Great novel currently at volume 12 waiting for English translations of later ones. The story is definitely fun and entertaining, development of characters is very well thought out. Although you can its a typical harem as far as relationships towards the main male protagonist, and there is a lack of interesting drama. Won't say too much about it as it'll ruin volume 11 which was interesting since its probably the one instance of surprise, which gets quickly dispelled in the following volume. Would of been better to see that issue to have been drawn out longer or at least not have a chapters prior to the grand entry revealing said plot point is alright.

                    Bottom line its still a great read, baka tsui has most of the volumes following the show and for the missing part you can easily get by with some summaries/translations from other sites to fill in. Definitely should check it out and the anime for that matter."</p>

                <p>"The characters of DxD come in huge quantity. Even so they don't feel underdeveloped, which I consider to be a pretty impressive feat. I speak as a author when I say it's extremely hard to juggle plot and character development at the same time. DxD features the sort of characters who would feature on polls as the greatest love pairing, the ultimate good guy or the biggest badass had they been written into Western novels.

                    Serious but silly, funny but sometimes dark, engrossing and entertaining.
                    
                    Needless to say, I think you ought to read this...."
