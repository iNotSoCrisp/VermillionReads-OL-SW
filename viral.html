                Scrawny high school student Hobin Yoo is probably the last guy you’d expect to star in a NewTube Channel that revolves around fighting.

                <p>"Initially I thought I could drop this work right away but it became more interesting as I read it. Comedy didn't work for me in the first few chapters, but after a while I was finding many of the happenings funny. Being a youtuber is a reality that is a little easier to connect cause most young people today know or follow the platform. It's interesting how the protagonist learns, grows and understands better about self-defense each chapter. Looking forward to see where and how far the story goes. Recommend If you are a fan of comedy and martial arts manga/manwha."</p>

                <p>"Viral Hit/How to Fight has a really good start. The story is about Hobin Yoo who is a weak kid that that gets regularly bullied at school but more importantly is poor and him and his mom are financially struggling. When he suddenly makes it big on youtube by mistakenly livestreaming him and his friend having a pathetic fist fight, he realizes he can make money off Youtube by streaming him fighting bullies and in the process learns how to fight. The fights are great, the writer used two professional fighters as advisors on the choreography and the art is amazing, one of my favorite ...."</p>
