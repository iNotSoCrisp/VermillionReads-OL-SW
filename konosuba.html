            <p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Kazuma Satou lives a laughable and pathetic life, being a shut-in NEET with no distinguishable qualities other than an addiction to video games. On his way home, Kazuma dies trying to save a girl from an oncoming truck—or so he believes. In reality, the "truck" was a slow-moving tractor, and he merely died from shock.

                Waking up in limbo between death and heaven, Kazuma finds himself facing the arrogant goddess Aqua. Here, he must choose between two options: go on to heaven or be sent to a fantasy world that needs his help to defeat the Demon King. Initially unimpressed by the challenging prospect of fighting a Demon King, Kazuma changes his mind after Aqua tells him he can bring any one item he wants. What better choice does Kazuma have than the goddess standing before him?
                
                Unfortunately, after the two arrive in their new world, two things become clear: Aqua is useless beyond belief, and life in this fantasy realm will be anything but smooth sailing. From paying for food and accommodations to trying to learn new skills, the duo's problems are just starting to take shape—and the arrival of eccentric allies may only make things worse.

                <p>"Konosuba is an isekai for people who dislike isekai. Well, can be a fun watch for people who like the genre too of course, but if you’ve grown tired of the overused tropes and carbon-copy protagonists this one is a nice change.

                    This is a tale of a dysfunctional dungeon party and the chemistry between the characters is what makes the series so enjoyable. Starting with the main character who is a lazy, unmotivated, good for nothing, cowardly and with personal gain as the primary goal. In other words, actually relatable protagonist. Next in line we have a goddess with negative IQ that others thinks is crazy for claiming she’s divine, a literal meat shield tank whose masochism is levelled much higher than any close combat skills and a dps who is completely useless except for being a portable nuclear explosion with a 24h cooldown. There is not one properly heroic among the protagonist, just a bunch of lovable defects with a writing that sneers at traditional isekai stories.
                    
                    It is thanks to this that Konosuba achieved such entertaining chaotic energy and reading it feels like riding a train with no brakes on planet comedy. Now of course, comedy is quite subjective matter, which is why the genre is more difficult to review than others. Just trust me that it’s not common for books to make me laugh out loud and Konosuba did precisely that numerous times. I’m amazed by how it keeps inventing hilarious situations with character flaws that could be seen as one trick pony if used wrong.
                    
                    Now, there is one small problem and that is the finale of the last volume. Before it was even translated there were already leakers calling it weird and disappointing, and claiming it ruined the series. So I was understandably worried as I picked it up and as I was reading through it. Thankfully, those worries were entirely unfounded and I have no idea what was there for people to dislike. The finale stayed true to the Konosuba spirit with no derailing and gave me some good laughs.
                    
                    So, this is a series I wholly recommend. Unless you hate fun or something."</p>

                <p>"This story is action-packed and full of funny tales. I couldn't contain myself when reading and it felt as though my sides were hurting the whole time. They call me an Aqua-Simp hehehe. I also like megumi bc her character design and attitude is very funny and amazing. Furthermore, I relate to the main character a lot. I would honestly do the same things he does if i got isekai'd myself. In fact, I would want to get Isekai'd and sent to another dimension and live funny tales like these guys.

                    10/10 recommend if u want to laugh all story long and if u like giggles."
