            <br>
            <p>
                The Lombardis were the most powerful family that ever existed in the empire. With unimaginable wealth, they shaped history, culture, and the arts—their influence rivaling that of the emperor. However, the family collapsed after making an alliance with the first prince, which resulted in futility as the second-born Perez Brivachali Durelli was crowned instead.

                A Korean woman is reincarnated as Firentia, the daughter of a Lombardi and a commoner. Despite her status as an illegitimate child, her father and grandfather love her, and she works hard to keep her family's prestige intact. After the two pass away, Firentia is kicked out and has since regretted how her relatives have torn the Lombardi name to shreds.
                
                On the verge of dying due to a carriage accident, Firentia is mysteriously given another chance in life and wakes up as her seven-year-old self. Firentia will not waste this opportunity, and if she wants to save her father and prevent the Lombardi's fall, she must prove to her grandfather her merit to become the next head of the family.            </p>

                    The art style definitely suits the characters and story. It makes it more visually appealing and we have a more realistic take of how the characters look and can easily tell their expressions.

                    For an isekai-time travel type of manga, it’s very interesting. The story is unique (I am not an active manga reader so I don’t know about others except those that already have an anime).
                    
                    What makes even more enjoyable is that there are no supernatural characters. So no one is over-powered and it lessens the impact of how they’d have to include that and if that happened we would have had some boring fight scenes and power explaining. I love that the author chose a more simplistic approach.                </p>

                    This story doesn't have superpowers, nobody is able to fly or has super strenght, the clichés end on the starting plot, the story is carefully constructed to be EXTREMELY realistic, given its premises, people don't simply love her, everything she has and everyone around her must be conquered, earned, and things are not simply given to her. Deus ex machina resolutions are not around, as well as Mary Sues. Everything just makes sense.
